## Dataset

[Chars74K Dataset](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/demos/chars74k/index.html)

The labels are 0-9, A-Z, and a-z.

## Objective

The main objectives was to train a deep Computer Vision (CV) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the highest accuracy possible.

This task was chosen to augment my Natural Language Processing (NLP) skills, and possibly bridge the two Machine Learning fields.

## Preliminary Results

After working on the project for the allotted 1 week, an accuracy of 60% was achieved on the Test Set.

The lower score is partially due to look alike characters, and inexperience building CV CNNs.

Refer to the following for details:

## Further Results

After the Capstone project was presented in partial fulfillment to complete the Divergence Academy Data Science Immersive course,
I decided to continue improving the model.

Eventually, I may add hypertuning of parameters to see how far I can get.

New results:  **_TBD_**
